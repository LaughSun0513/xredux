# XRedux
An upgrade for redux. Inspired by [dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva) and [mirrorx](https://github.com/mirrorjs/mirror).

# Why XRedux
XRedux is not a framework like dva and mirrorx. It's just a plain libray and it solves the two problems that redux brought about.
  1. Following redux rules, we need create actions„ÄÅreducers even more files. This will lead to mental leap.
  2. Redux didn't solve the async action.
So We need a higher abstraction.
